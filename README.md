# Hand-written-digits-recognition

Handwritten digit recognition is the ability of a computer to recognize the human handwritten digits from different sources like images, papers, touch screens, etc and classify them into predefined classes. 
This has been a topic of boundless-research in the field of deep learning. 
In Hand written digit recognition, we face many challenges because of different peoples as it is not an optical character recognition. 
The major goal of the proposed system is understanding Convolutional Neural Network, and applying it to the handwritten recognition system.
The interesting Python project requires you to have basic knowledge of Python programming,deep learning with Keras library and the Tkinter library for building GUI.
